# PandaUniqueItem

## Description

A simple mod that adds lore text to say who forged an item and when when changing an items name in the anvil.
Removing a custom name in an anvil also removes the lore.

When an item holds sentimental value, nothing prevents someone  from creating a duplicate with the same name and enchantments, making it impossible to distinguish between the originals.
This mod solves that.

## Works Great With

[Panda Block Name](https://modrinth.com/mod/pandablockname)   
    By using them together, you can name blocks, and they will keep their forged lore & custom name when placed and picked up again.
